        Paragraphs are medium-sized units of writing, longer than sentences, but
        shorter than sections, chapters, or entire works. Because they connect
        the “small” ideas of individual sentences to a “bigger” idea, paragraph
        structure is essential to any writing for organization, flow, and
        comprehension. Students have a lot of questions when it comes to writing
        a paragraph: How many sentences should you use? How do you transition
        within a paragraph? When do you end a paragraph? Etc. Below we explain
        everything you need to know about paragraph structure to write like an
        expert, including several paragraph examples.
